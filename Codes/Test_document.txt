Major/Concentration in Data Science
What courses to take.Data All AroundLots of data is being collected and warehoused 
Web data, e-commerce
Financial transactions, bank/credit transactions
Online trading and purchasing
Social Network
How Much Data Do We have?Google processes 20 PB a day (2008)
Facebook has 60 TB of daily logs
eBay has 6.5 PB of user data + 50 TB/day (5/2009)
1000 genomes project: 200 TB


Cost of 1 TB of disk: $35
Time to read 1 TB disk: 3 hrs 
      (100 MB/s)Big DataBig Data is any data that is expensive to manage and hard to extract value from 
Volume
The size of the data
Velocity
The latency of data processing relative to the growing demand for interactivity
Variety and Complexity
the diversity of sources, formats, quality, structures.
Big DataTypes of Data We HaveRelational Data (Tables/Transaction/Legacy Data)
Text Data (Web)
Semi-structured Data (XML) 
Graph Data
Social Network, Semantic Web (RDF), … 
Streaming Data 
You can afford to scan the data once
What To Do With These Data?Aggregation and Statistics 
Data warehousing and OLAP
Indexing, Searching, and Querying
Keyword based search 
Pattern matching (XML/RDF)
Knowledge discovery
Data Mining
Statistical Modeling
Big Data and Data Science“… the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians,” Hal Varian, Google Chief Economist
The U.S. will need 140,000-190,000 predictive analysts and 1.5 million managers/analysts by 2018. McKinsey Global Institute’s June 2011
New Data Science institutes being created or repurposed – NYU, Columbia, Washington, UCB,...
New degree programs, courses, boot-camps:
e.g., at Berkeley: Stats, I-School, CS, Astronomy…
One proposal (elsewhere) for an MS in “Big Data Science”What is Data Science?An area that manages, manipulates, extracts, and interprets knowledge from tremendous amount of data
Data science (DS) is a multidisciplinary field of study with goal to address the challenges in big data
Data science principles apply to all data – big and smallhttps://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/What is Data Science?Theories and techniques from many fields and disciplines are used to investigate and analyze a large amount of data to help decision makers in many industries such as science, engineering, economics, politics, finance, and education
